Exit, as the name suggests is the UNIX way of returning from a process after termination. However, as simple as it may sound, exiting in UNIX can be handled in multiple ways, and each way has it's own effects. We're gonna look into 3 kinds of exit function here, namely, 'exit', '_Exit' or '_exit'.
### The exit call
exit is synonymous with the traditional return call that one is more familiar with. There are however subtle differences that can be explored [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/461449/return-statement-vs-exit-in-main). But, in this context, we are gonna ignore them. The salient features of the exit call are:-
* Exit when used executes all exit handlers (atexit) and flushes out IO buffers and closes them.
* All the functions expect an exit status parameter (except return which can have void too)

### What the heck is an Exit Handler?
An exit handler in C, given by the 'atexit' function is like a function registrar that allows the function registered to fire upon termination of the program. Let's see an example to understand better. 
{% highlight c %}
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
void fire_on_exit()
{
	printf ("Exiting from Program!!\n");
}
int main()
{
	atexit(fire_on_exit);          //register fire_on_exit for firing on exit
	return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %} 
The output I don't intend to display as I'm sure it is pretty clear and better in the interest to keep the post short. Upon execution of 'return 0' statement, the function 'fire_on_exit' is called (before kernel returns to it's parent with the return status).
### exit/return vs _exit/_Exit
The exit/return call flush out IO buffers, and call atexit handlers, however, _exit/_Exit don't. An example can clarify better.
{% highlight c %}
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
void fire_on_exit()
{
	printf ("Exiting from Program!!\n");
}
int main()
{
	atexit(fire_on_exit);
	printf ("Hello World!!\n");
	exit(0);    //use _exit once.
}
{% endhighlight %}
The output in the case when exit/return is used.
{% highlight io %}
Hello World
Exiting from Program!!
{% endhighlight %}
However, no output was produced when _exit/_Exit was used.<br />
**NOTE:** It is to be noted not to use "\n" or new line character in printf to observe the behaviour. The reason behind this is that buffered IO from STDIN/STDOUT like printf, scanf are newline buffered.i.e. They are flushed at each newline. So, even in the case of _exit/_Exit, output will get printed.
{% highlight c %}
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
void fire_on_exit()
{
	printf ("Exiting from Program!!\n");
}
int main()
{
	atexit(fire_on_exit);
	printf ("Hello World\n");
	_exit(0);
}
{% endhighlight %}
The buffer gets flushed out to STDOUT when "\n" is encountered in "Hello World" string, and thus gets printed.
{% highlight io %}
Hello World
{% endhighlight %}
### Which one to use??
It is advisable to use '_exit' in child processes as they don't interfere with exit handlers. Otherwise, below given situation may arise:-
{% highlight c %}
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
void fire_on_exit()
{
	printf ("Exiting from Program!!\n");
}
int main()
{
	int pid=fork();
	atexit(fire_on_exit);
	if (pid < 0) {
		//Fork Failed!!
	}
	else if (pid == 0) {
		exit(5);
	}
	else {
	    //Do Parent Stuff
	}
	return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}
The above program prints "Exiting from Program" twice. Since atexit was initialised outside, hence, it registered 'fire_on_exit' for both the child & parent. This is undesirable. Imagine a situation where 'fire_on_exit' deals with FILE IO, or some crucial networking task. In that case, upon child termination, it may interfere with what the parent was supposed to do. Hovewer, it can be avoided by programming carefully, but still, it is best to use _exit in such cases.
