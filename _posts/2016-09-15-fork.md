**Fork()??** Never heard of it? or Never used it?? Well it's definitely not the cutlery you're thinking!!<br />

This might sound a bit insulting to someone who hasn't used it explicitly anywhere in programs, but believe me we numerously use this system call each time we operate a system (specifically an [UNIX based system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) ,don't know about Windows!!). Let's understand fork from the scenario when we boot our computer.<br />
As soon as we boot our system, system process such as [init]({% post_url 2017-03-03-init %}) begins to execute after being fetched from ROM. How does application processes and other non-system process begins to execute?? Here comes the question of having a way for a process, in our case _system processes_ to create new processes. Fork() comes to the rescue at this point.<br />
So basically, we now have a vague idea about what fork does. It merely provides a facility to an ongoing process to create new processes. Now, let's dive into the insights of fork and how we can use it in C programs.

### Fork() Insights
Before diving into programs, we must understand the technicalities of fork.<br />
Fork is a system call (involves rerouting execution from user space to kernel space). What fork does is that it creates another process that is a copy of itself. What?? Yeah, the new process created has all the properties (data) as it was in it's parent process. This involves open file descriptors, IO buffers, stack memory, program memory and blah blah blah. However a new process ID is designated by the OS to distinguish between the parent and the child.<br />
So, how come we go about doing different stuff with our child because the child too executes the same progrram as the parent (Program memory was copied too!!)??<br />
That's why the Fork call was designed in a manner to return two different values to the parent and child. **0 value to the child process, and a positive value that is also the process ID of the child to the parent process**. Well,,what good does that do??<br />
Haha!!, That merely solves the whole problem. We can now structure our program with additional if-elses and check return values of fork, and act accordingly:-
{% highlight c %}
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>    //Header File includes fork
int main()
{
	//Do stuff whatever
	int pid = fork();              //pid contains the Process ID of the Child upon successful fork
	if (pid < 0)
		printf ("Child Creation Failed");
	if (pid == 0) {
		//Do Child specific Stuff
	}
	else if (pid > 0) {
		//Do Parent specific Stuff
	}
	//Only Do stuff that is common to both child and parent
	return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}
Ohh!!, If child creation fails, a negative value is returned (possibly -1, not so sure) by fork. Now let's understand how the above snippet executes:-<br />
Initially there was only one process running the program, after the fork call child was created. Now, talking about the execution of the child:- **The child begins execution from the statement succeeding fork. Thus the part in comments "Do stuff whatever" including the fork call never gets executed by the child. For the child execution begins from "if (pid < 0)". Well, that particular if also doesn't get executed in child.** (Think about it!!)

### Child Process has it's own set of Data
To prove this we run the following program:-
{% highlight c %}
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
int main()
{
	int a=5;
	int pid = fork();
	if (pid < 0)
		printf ("Child Creation Failed");
	if (pid == 0) {
		printf ("Value in child:- %d", ++a);
	}
	else if (pid > 0) {
		printf ("Value in parent:- %d", --a);
	}
	return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}
The output was as:-
{% highlight io %}
Value in parent:- 4
Value in child:- 6
{% endhighlight %}
The child incremented it's own copy to 6, however the parent decremented it's own copy to 4.
### getpid() and getppid()
Well, this section is not directly related to fork, but it is quite important. getpid() gives us the process id of the current process and getppid(), the process id of it's parent. One can use these functions to debug a cumbersome code or just for observation as I did below:-
{% highlight c %}
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
int main()
{
	int pid = fork();
	if (pid < 0)
		printf ("Child Creation Failed");
	if (pid == 0) {
		printf ("Process ID of parent and child are as:- %d %d\n", getppid(), getpid());
	}
	else if (pid > 0) {
		printf ("Process ID of parent:- %d\n", getpid());
	}
	return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}
The output was:-
{% highlight io %}
Process ID of parent:- 13480
Process ID of parent and child are as:- 13480 13481
{% endhighlight %}
Well that ends our basic introduction to fork. There's a great video discussing fork with images portraying what really happens in the RAM while forking a new process. Skip to __22:38__.

I wanted to discuss some buffered IO anomalies (printf, scanf etc.) in programs using fork but for that we need to understand some more system calls (_exit, exit, wait, ...).<br />
